### PROBLEMS

Please, look at the FAQ before posting a new issue. Also, make sure it has not been asked before. https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/wiki/FAQ

Keep in mind that many problems come from faulty power sources and corrupted SD cards, so make sure this is not the case for you before reporting.

If you are running into problems, make sure to include the output of `sudo ncp-report`
